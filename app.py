Glam Shelf Twin — Phase 0
Flask app that drafts WhatsApp customer-service replies in The Glam Shelf voice.

Runs on:
  - Local Windows: `python app.py` → Flask dev server on http://localhost:5000
  - Render (Linux): `gunicorn app:app` via Procfile, binds to $PORT

Auth: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable.
  - Local: put it in .env (loaded by python-dotenv)
  - Render: set it in the service's Environment dashboard

      - /api/v1/sendSessionMessage/{wa_id} — used for replies WITHIN the
        24-hour session window after a customer's last inbound message.
        This is always our case: auto-replies fire only in direct response
        to a webhook event, so we're guaranteed to be in-session.
      - /api/v1/sendTemplateMessage — required for messages OUTSIDE the
        24h window, must use a pre-approved HSM template, takes different
        fields (messageType, template name, parameters). Not used here.

    Field shape: sendSessionMessage takes `messageText` as a URL QUERY
    PARAMETER, not a JSON body field. Putting it in the body causes WATI
    to respond with {"result": false, "info": "message text can not be
    empty"} (HTTP 200 — see the result-check note below). The body is
    sent empty. Fields like messageType / isHSM / conversationId belong
    to sendTemplateMessage and would be ignored or rejected here.

    IMPORTANT — WATI returns HTTP 200 even on logical failures. The real
    outcome lives in the JSON body as {"result": true|false, "info": ...}.
    We log the full response body so any failures are visible in Render
    logs, and we treat result=false as a failure even on HTTP 200.

    All failures are logged and swallowed — the /webhook handler must
    always return 200 to WATI to prevent retries / duplicate replies.
